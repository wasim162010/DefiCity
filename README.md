#4th May 2021 

#this is the first commit of the MVP.

#this code contains a bare minimum ERC20 smart contract with feature to upgrade using OpenZeppeli truffle upgrade feature, web3.js functions to call them and APIs created using the express-js

#It must be noted that it's an ongoing work and not all the functionalities have been implemented, so lots of code refinements will be done. So, if something is not formed properly, it will be rectified and missing functionalities will be implemented.

#It must be good to have a node version of 14.
